## Requirements

1. Install the Angular CLI

    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

2. Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

3. Set up a Cosmos DB server with a MongoDB database. Make sure you note the name of the Azure Cosmos DB account, the name of the database, the primary password and the port. You can find all this information in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-cosmosdb.git
    cd angular-cosmosdb
    ```

2. Install the npm packages

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

3. Configure Cosmos DB server settings

    Rename the `example-environment.js` file to `environment.js` in the `server/env/` folder and update it with your Cosmos DB settings. Replace the account, database name, key, and port with your specific configuration.

    ```javascript
    // server/env/environment.js

    module.exports = {
      accountName: 'your-cosmosdb-account-name-goes-here',
      databaseName: 'your-cosmosdb-database-name-goes-here',
      key: 'your-key-goes-here',
      port: 10255
    };
    ```

## Running the app

1. Build the Angular app

    ```bash
    ng build
    ```

2. Launch the server

    ```bash
    node src/server/index.js
    ```

3. Open the browser to http://localhost:3000
